# CS50 Yearbook ðŸ¥³

A GitHub Pages website that allows CS50 students from all over the world to record their participation in its courses.

This repo was created in under than 2 hours just to start working on the idea and create a place for contributions. This means that contributions of any kind are always welcomed to develop this site to repersent all CS50 students.

So, go ahead, clone this repo, and show us what you can do ðŸ˜Ž


### Ideas / To do:
* Better design (Currently the website is just an HTML page and the design is not ideal at all).
* Automating adding users.
* Adding link to certificates for finished courses.
